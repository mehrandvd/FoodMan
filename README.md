# FoodMan
This project is started to facilitate ordering foods for developers!

This project is based on an idea by Afshin Alizadeh.
The idea is simple. Why don't we have a PowerShell way to explore and order foods, for GEEKS!

So we came into creating this project. Using it is simple:

Import-Module FoodMan.PowerShell.dll 


Now a new drive added to drives called FoodMan. So you can:

```PowerShell
cd FoodMan: 
```

and then get the list of foods. For example:

``` PowerShell
 ls | ft name, price 
```
